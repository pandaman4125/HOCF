                                                        | Born in 1995 in Detroit, Michigan, Lauren Farhat's journey has been one of resilience and triumph over adversity. From a young age, she faced the challenges of a hip deformity and limb deficiency known as Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency (PFFD), undergoing numerous surgeries in attempts to correct it. Despite the hardships and frequent hospital visits, Lauren refused to let her circumstances define her. Raised primarily by her single mother, Shelly, Lauren drew inspiration from her mother's unwavering work ethic and dedication to providing for their family. Determined to contribute and alleviate some of the financial strain, Lauren began working as a golf caddie at age 12, earning the prestigious Evans Scholarshipâ€”a testament to her academic excellence and financial need. After graduating college and entering the workforce, Lauren discovered CrossFit, where she found her true calling. With the support of mentors like Mat Fraser and Kerry Sproles, she quickly rose to prominence in the adaptive athlete community. In 2023, Lauren made her debut at the CrossFit Games and went on to claim first place in her division at the WheelWod Games, showcasing her skill, determination, and hard work.

Starting gymnastics at age 4, she worked her way to being a competitive level 10 gymnast and the top high school gymnast in her state. While her intent was to compete for a division 1 college team, during her senior year of high school she broke her back during a fall from the uneven bars and became paralyzed from the waist down. She spent the next decade focused on academics, earning degrees from Princeton University, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and Columbia University School of Nursing. However, once she found CrossFit in 2018, she found her competitive drive again and hasn't looked back. She has been named CrossFit's Fittest on Earth for the last 4 years running and is just starting competitive rock climbing, with her sights on representing Team USA throughout the 2025 paraclimbing world cup series.

                                                        | Pedro won the Colorado Karting Tour a few months out of chemotherapy, and hasn't slowed down since. He is often praised for being the most motivated driver on the grid, because he eats, breathes, and sleeps karting. He trains hard on the track and off the track in his sim racer and at the crossfit gym.

                                                        | Pedro's unique position as the only adaptive youth go-kart driver competing on the national circuit gives him a unique position where he gets to speak with the media quite a bit on racing as an adaptive athlete and on chasing his big dreams. Pedro also gets over 1 MILLION views on social media per month, as this is where he shares daily updates.
